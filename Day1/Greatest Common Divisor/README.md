# Program: Greatest Common Divisor of two numbers
* In this program, two integers are taken in variables num1&num2 are passed to a function which returns the GCD.

* In the function, we first determine the smaller of the two numbers since the GCD can only be less than or equal to the smallest number.   We then use a for loop to go from 1 to that number.

* In each iteration, we have to check if our number perfectly divides both the input numbers. If so, we store the number as GCD.

* At the completion of the loop we end up with the largest number that perfectly divides both the numbers.
