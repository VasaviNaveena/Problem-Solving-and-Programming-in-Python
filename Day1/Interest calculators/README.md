## Simple Interest
1.	User must enter the values for the principle Amount, Rate of interest and Time(in Years).
2.	The formula: `SI = (PA*T*R)/100` is used to compute simple interest.
3.	The simple interest is printed.

## Compound Interest
1. User must enter the values for the principle Amount, Rate of interest and Time(in Years).
2. The formula: `CI = PA * (pow((1 + R / 100), T))` is used to compute Compound interest.
3. The Compound interest is printed.
