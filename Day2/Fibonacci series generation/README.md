# Program: Fibonacci series generation

1. User must enter the number of terms and store it in a variable.
2. The number is passed as an argument to a recursive function.
3. The base condition is that the number has to be lesser than or equal to 1.
4. Otherwise the function is called recursively with the argument as the number minus 1 added to the function called recursively with the argument as the number minus 2.
5. The result is returned and a for statement is used to print the fibonacci series.
